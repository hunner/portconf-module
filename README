portconf

Normally using a package with 'provider => portupgrade' would use the default
compile-time options. Traditionally the way to manage these options is to push
out a pkgtools.conf via puppet, but this is complex, clunky, and doesn't cover
all the options.

The portconf package can be used on FreeBSD to set compile-time options for
running `make` directly in the ports directory, `portupgrade` initial compiles,
`portupgrade` upgrade compiles, and `portupgrade` dependency compiles.
